New Open-Transactions Command Line Interface

Work summary:

- [works, more todo] Tree of commands - full model of possible commands and options understood by program.
- Scalability - adding new command, with the validation, completion for all arguments and options, and with binding to OT command, takes usually 2 lines of C++ code to bind.
- [testing] Validation - checking syntax as well as data correctness (e.g. check with wallet/address book) of the data before executing OT command.
- [works, more todo] Hinting - auto completion and display possible propositions of the commands and arguments.
- EditLine library integration - History functionality with scrolling through history and saving to file. Display prepared hints, and or files. 
- Planning to use compatible with EditLine - WinEditLine for Windows.

- [testing] Support for multiple words names through quotes.

- Commands take both IDs and aliases as arguments (ID must be prepend by special prefix character '^') - so local nyms etc. are easy to use and remember. Aliases are obligatory.
- So far there is over 40 working  commands including messaging, managing nyms, assets and servers. 

- Application can be run in different modes - easy modifying of application parameters (e.g. redirecting debug to file, no debug).
- Working completion and command execution in bash shell
- [testing, prove of concept] Linux daemon for fast bash auto completion without reload of OTAPI 
- Use of external text editor (unix only), when entering multi line text. 

- Test commands  - that we are using to test specific CLI functionalities, like tab completions or building tree of commands.
- [pending code review] Secure code - asserts in many places, advanced debug.

- Working on unit tests that will be checking of validity of all commands, hinting.
- Local configuration files - read and save defaults IDs: account, asset, nym, server.
- We are preparing graphical documentation that will present tree of all CLI commands in clear and simple way.
- Help - named arguments, types of arguments and description for each command. Detailed help for single commands.  Automatically generated list of all commands with variables and options (colorful output):

- Colorful debug and help displaying
- Colored nicks, tables, account ballance
